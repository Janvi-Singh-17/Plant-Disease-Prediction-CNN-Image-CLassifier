##  🌟 Overview

Plant diseases are one of the significant factors affecting crop yield. This project leverages CNNs to analyze plant leaf images and detect potential diseases. The system can classify leaves into healthy or various diseased categories based on the dataset provided.

## 📚 Features

- Detect multiple plant diseases from leaf images.
- Uses a deep learning model based on CNN architecture.
- Easy-to-use interface for predictions.
- Scalable and customizable for new datasets or plant types.

## 📑 Dataset

The model is trained using publicly available datasets of plant leaf images. 
PlantVillage Dataset link:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease), which includes thousands of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

**Key Dataset Details:**
- Number of classes: e.g., Tomato Early Blight, Tomato Late Blight, etc.
- Format: Images (JPEG/PNG)
- Dataset split: 80% Training, 10% Validation, 10% Testing
